## Project Details

### Task 1: Restaurant Recommendation System
**Objective:** Create a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
- **Recommendation Criteria:** Determined the criteria for recommendations, such as cuisine preference and price range.
- **Approach:** Implemented a content-based filtering approach to recommend restaurants similar to user preferences.
- **Evaluation:** Tested the recommendation system with sample user preferences.

### Task 2: Cuisine Classification
**Objective:** Classify cuisines based on restaurant data.

- **Dataset Preparation:** Cleaned and processed the dataset for classification.
- **Model Implementation:** Used machine learning algorithms to classify cuisines effectively.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Task 3: Location-Based Recommendation System
**Objective:** Develop a system that recommends restaurants based on user location.

- **Geolocation Data:** Incorporated geolocation data to enhance recommendation relevance.
- **Clustering:** Used K-Means clustering to group restaurants based on geographic proximity.
- **Visualization:** Implemented a visualization tool using Folium to display restaurant clusters on a map.

### Task 4: Analysis and Insights from Restaurant Data
**Objective:** Extract insights from restaurant datasets to guide business decisions.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted thorough analysis to identify trends and patterns in restaurant performance.
- **Visualization:** Created visual representations of key metrics to aid in decision-making.
- **Recommendations:** Provided actionable insights based on data analysis.
